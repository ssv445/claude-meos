# {{USER_NAME}}'s Workspace

## About This Workspace

This is my personal operating system for managing work - projects, notes, ideas, and daily workflows. Development projects live in separate repositories; this workspace manages everything around them.

## How Claude Should Help

Claude acts as an **active work partner** in this workspace.

### On Session Start

When I open Claude in this project, proactively:

1. **Show recent accomplishments** - Check today's and yesterday's daily notes, list what was completed
2. **Surface pending items** - Scan project CLAUDE.md files for "Next Tasks", highlight priorities
3. **Ask what to work on** - "What would you like to focus on today?"
4. **Check if today is captured** - If no daily note exists, offer to create one

### Status Signals to Check

- Today's daily note in `/notes/daily/`
- Yesterday's daily note (reflection, tomorrow's priority)
- Each project's CLAUDE.md for active tasks
- Recent git commits for activity context

### Ongoing Support

1. **Check current status** - Scan daily notes, project CLAUDE.md files, and recent activity
2. **Surface actionable items** - List what needs attention today
3. **Ask what to accomplish** - Guide focus based on priorities
4. **Help execute** - Draft content, prep materials, track progress

### Plan Mode

- Make plans extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for brevity.
- List unresolved questions at end of each plan.

## Folder Structure

```
/{{WORKSPACE_PATH}}/
  CLAUDE.md                   # This file - central control
  /projects/                  # One folder per project
    /project-name/
      CLAUDE.md               # Project-specific instructions
      /meetings/              # Meeting notes for this project
  /notes/
    /daily/                   # Daily notes (YYYY-MM-DD.md)
    /captures/                # Quick thoughts and ideas
  /templates/                 # Reusable templates
```

## Project Management

### Code vs Management Separation

For projects with code:
- Code repo (separate directory) - everything the project needs to run
- This workspace's projects/ folder - planning, notes, research, decisions
- Never mix them. Keeps repos clean and management centralized.

### Creating a New Project
1. Create folder in `/projects/project-name/`
2. Add `CLAUDE.md` with: purpose, status, mode, key files, next tasks
3. If project has code: note the code repo path

### Project Status Values
- **active** - Currently working on
- **paused** - On hold temporarily
- **passive** - Dormant, load context only when needed
- **completed** - Done, may archive later

### Project Modes
- **personal** - Private projects
- **professional** - Work-related
- **public** - Content meant for sharing

## Daily Notes Workflow

### Morning
1. Create daily note from template
2. Review yesterday's notes and "tomorrow's priority"
3. Set today's 3 focus items
4. List tasks for work/personal/learning

### End of Day
1. Update task completion status
2. Write reflection (what went well, what to improve)
3. Set tomorrow's top priority

---

## Meeting Notes Rules

1. Store in project folder - `/projects/<project>/meetings/`
2. Multi-project meetings - split content to each project
3. Naming: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`

---

## Conventions

### Naming
- Project folders: lowercase with hyphens
- Daily notes: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Meeting notes: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`
- No spaces in file or folder names

---
